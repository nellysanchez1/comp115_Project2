Data visualization using a biology project data to create charts that will help to understand and assimilate the information
I used the averages of each temperatures, as that would give a better idea of all the trials information without using too much data on the chart.
The biolgy project is about finding the ideal temperature in which the production of CO2 will be more optimal. 
The lineplot is the perfect chart for this type of visualization as it can show which of the temperature had the most CO2 production.
